Organic Chemistry II Lab Reports (Mostly-Incomplete)
All the lab reports written for Organic Chemistry II Lab 310 at Rutgers University with Professor John Taylor 2019. Includes Unknown Analysis given at the start to be found by the end of the semester. NOTE: These lab reports are not completely finished as I printed them to fill in the blank spots with the mechanisms, diagrams, etc.
